## ML-algorithms
This repository provides my own implementation of machine learning library on native Python + NumPy. Some architectural ideas, features and models' parameters
were taken from scikit-learn.

## Directories

### tree 
- DecisionTreeClassifier. Builds a decision tree by ID3 algorithm. Other algorithms will be added later.

### ensemble
- RandomForestClassifier. Builds n DecisionTreeClassifiers and returns their average predictions
